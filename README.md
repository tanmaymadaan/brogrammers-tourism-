#Moods To Maps (M2M): 
##Input mood. Output locations. 
##(The revolutionary idea of emotion-driven tourism) 
####We give recommendations for places-to-visit based on your mood and emotional state. 

We extract emotions from input text and recommend locations which mirror the user's state of mind. We're aiming at the tagging places with emotions, and give location recommendations based on mood (similar to what spotify does for music). Our recommendations are driven by people's moods and emotions rather than comparative ratings on a place, because tourism is a personal, emotional experience more than a comparative one. The 'one-size-fits-all' philosophy of these tourism packages don't recognize the subjectivity of the tourist experience, and how your mood and emotions are a better predictor of what places you'd like to see, than comparative ratings. The big idea here is to make tourism recommendations a more humane experience, and make the globe searchable in terms of emotions. 

//ADD PARAGRAPH ABOUT AUGEMENTED REALITY

As the userbase grows, we can incorporate THEIR stories for even greater accuracy and user-satisfaction. A future update may incorporate a gamification-based augemented reality UI to incentivize tourist exploration, and even try crowd-funding restoration of monuments. The possibilities are limitless.
 
Tourism By the end of 2015, the travel and tourism sector will contribute 7% to the Indian GDP. And the estimated number of smartphones in 2020 would be 6.1 billion (70% of the world's population, by then)[http://goo.gl/DyX2sV, http://goo.gl/Nx0c6o]. With this kind of economic leverage and market penetration, and keeping in mind the declining relevance of 'tourist-packages', we truly believe our application to be capable of changing the way people travel forever. Leaving them happier, more satisfied, giving them EXACTLY what they want using cutting-edge technologies like NLP and Augmented Reality.
